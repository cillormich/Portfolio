        <h2>Frontend Developer, UI-UX Designer & Author</h2>
        <div class="line1"></div>
        <p>All my life I've always found the tech industry fascinating. I'm a frontend web developer based in Lagos, Nigeria and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js are the languages I speak at the moment. This website, however, was built by me with only the first three languages and happens to be my first real project as a web developer. UI-UX Design is also part of what I do and I mostly use Figma and a bit of AdobeXD as design tools. I love research and writing for tech and subjects pertaining to humanity. I'm the author of YOUR PERSON IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE, a book often described as the readerâ€™s one and only ultimate guide for winning and survival. I do not know so much, I believe in constant learning and improvement. But I love building and creating amazing and unique projects for the user to have a wonderful experience. Apart from web/app development, I'm also very much interested in Machine Learning/Robotics, Games Development, the Language of Computing, Telecommunications & Renewable Energy, Cloud Computing & the Internet of Things. <br> <br> I started my Web Development journey by learning to write codes in the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and then React.js. Even now, I still have a lot to learn especially in vanilla JS & REACT. I am seriously looking for mentors who are very good at programming languages so that I can learn more from them, the same way I am open for any form of project collaboration or to work as an intern/junior so that I can have some work experience. I am a person with some stellar qualities and professionalism when it comes to work and creating things. Having a degree in Linguistics & Communication Studies, I used to study and teach in a university the morphology and syntax of natural languages, now I've switched to using the syntax of computer languages to build things. I hope to work very hard in this tech industry and to be able to get to the level where I want to be. If you think my site is good and you can work with me, I am readily available and you can always contact me via cillorman@gmail.com and I can assure you you'll be glad you did because I love work and dedication and I Design and Build Mature, Simple and User-Friendly Interfaces.</p>
