                                <p>All my life I've always found the tech industry fascinating. I'm a frontend web developer based in Lagos, Nigeria and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js are the languages I speak at the moment. This website, however, was built by me with only the first three languages and happens to be my first real project as a web developer. UI-UX Design is also part of what I do and I mostly use Figma and a bit of AdobeXD as design tools. I love research and writing for tech and subjects pertaining to humanity. I'm the author of YOUR PERSON IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE, a book often described as the readerâ€™s one and only ultimate guide for winning and survival. I do not know so much, I believe in constant learning and improvement. But I love building and creating amazing and unique projects for the user to have a wonderful experience. Apart from web/app development, I'm also very much interested in Machine Learning/Robotics, Games Development, the Language of Computing, Telecommunications & Renewable Energy, Cloud Computing & the Internet of Things.</p>

                <p>I started my Web Development journey by learning to write codes in the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and then React.js. Even now, I still have a lot to learn especially in vanilla JS & REACT. I am seriously looking for mentors who are very good at programming languages so that I can learn more from them, the same way I am open for any form of project collaboration or to work as an intern/junior so that I can have some work experience. I am a person with some stellar qualities and professionalism when it comes to work and creating things. Having a degree in Linguistics & Communication Studies, I used to study and teach in a university the morphology and syntax of natural languages, now I've switched to using the syntax of computer languages to build things. I hope to work very hard in this tech industry and to be able to get to the level where I want to be. If you think my site is good and you can work with me, I am readily available and you can always contact me via cillorman@gmail.com and I can assure you you'll be glad you did because I love work and dedication and <a href="portfolio.html"><span id="services-span">I Design and Build Mature, Simple and User-Friendly Interfaces.</span></a></p>

                    <h1>MEET ME AS AN AUTHOR</h1>
                    <p>Councillor Onyeama has always wanted to write a book that will communicate and reveal the unadulterated truth and basic realities about life, which will, in turn, teach the reader how best to live life and survive in a complex and highly competitive world. To write his first book, he was for nearly 10 years dedicated to studying life, people, the world, and human behaviour. This study gave rise to YOUR PERSON IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE. Within the years of research and writing of the book, he has worked as a reporter for a state broadcasting corporation as well as an office and teaching assistant in two Nigerian universities. He has a Degree in Linguistics and Communication Studies. He strongly believes that the best knowledge anyone can have - especially one for winning and survival - is knowledge about people. According to him, if we do not understand people and by extension, the world, we will for sure not be able to know how to succeed, win, survive, and even make our lives better. He bases his research and writing on these premises and writes books that teach same.</p>
