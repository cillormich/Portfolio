                    <h3>Men & Women</h3>
                    <p>There are five kinds of men virtually every woman wants:</p><br>
                    <p>The provider</p>
                    <p>The protector</p>
                    <p>The lover</p>
                    <p>The romantic</p>
                    <p>The intercourser</p> <br>
                    <p>Eventually, most men are the first and the second. But if any man be all of these all to himself, then he is a rare breed and the desire of every woman. If you have such a man in your life, then you are lucky and so be grateful. But if you don't, you can always have a way around it and make your man be the man you want him to be. It all depends on your understanding of YOUR PERSON IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE.</p>

                        <h4>BEST WAYS to follow/handle people who often front themselves as "more intelligent and hardworking."</h4> <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Never be jealous or envious of them. Never! Your brain is wired in a different way. You just have to understand what works best for you.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>In any discussion or argument with them, always leave them with these words: "You're right." Agree with whatever they're saying but what you'll do is registered in your mind.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>There's no competition in being intelligent and no one knows it all. You must protect your sanity at all times by "knowing" and "working" the best you can, you must not know and do everything. Be flexible, open-minded and happy.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>Use them instead. Use their knowledge, allow them to do most of the work, and let the stress of labour choke them while you continue to clear your head and your own space.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>As long as you get your job done, you have nothing to worry about. Always limit your efforts to your job description. Life is too short for you to be giving yourself some additional stress.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>Embrace social intelligence instead. Have a pleasant personality and learn the best way to socialise and relate with people. It is much more comforting.</li> <br>
    
                            <li>Finally, you must get better in the art of manoeuvre. Rather than isolate yourself from the power games people play, learn the best possible moves you can make to guarantee your safety.</li>

                    <h3>Life & Struggle</h3>
                    <p>Every day we wake up, we are grateful to the Creator for seeing the newness of the day and for being alive. Although most of us don't pray but rather go straight to our phone, God is so good and merciful that He doesn't count that for us. If we're in love, next we think about our partner, then our family and our job or hustle. Most of us come back home tired and broken, just keeping our heads above water and waiting for the month-end salary for us to smile again, go shopping and take care of our needs. And like a flash, the money is finished and we are back toiling and hoping again and again. On the other side of the struggling spectrum are those who live by the daily grind, if they fail to leave their house any day they won't find what to eat and if they have a family, there will be crisis at home. The truth of the matter is that whether it's the monthly paying job or the daily hustle, money is never enough. Unfortunately, while most of us make ends meet by the sweat of our brows, others make millions and billions by the push of a button---the very scarce and insatiable money encircling among the rich. While no one should blame or curse anyone for being rich, life, regardless, is unarguably unfair and is never balanced---what we get in quantum, others get in abundance and even more. And as crazy as it seems, those who need money most are those who don't get it, and their number is like the sands of the earth. Be that as it may, what challenges most of us every day and limits our progress is a general lack of understanding of the world we live in and the laws that govern the universe. Only when we know that we can be able to navigate life no matter its challenges, and to know what truly matters and what doesn't. This is for all those who struggle every day for survival. NEVER GIVE UP!</p>

                        <h3>ANGER IS TOXIC</h3>
                        <p>Whenever you're angry, like very angry and boiling inside because of a provocation from someone or something, it's best to say no word at the moment. Take a break and if possible sleep over it. When you wake the next day, you would see how foolish and stupid you would have been if you talked or acted out of anger. Anything you say or do when angry is 80% BS.</p>

                        <h3>LIFE, TRENDS, PEACE OF MIND</h3>
                        <p>There is so much noise in the world that the only peace of mind you can ever have is a sense of direction, knowing exactly what you want and the person you want to be. So many things are a distraction, a lot of trends are useless and petty, and every day you continue to get disturbed by flashes of things which not only waste your precious and limited time but misplaces your priority. Life can be a lot simpler without all this stress and strain of noise. Only pay attention to what really matters. <br> ~ Councillor Onyeama</p>

                        <h3>SOCIAL MEDIA LIFESTYLE</h3>
                        <p>Do not judge people by their social media lifestyles, their reality could be the very opposite. life is more than what you see online, and it is never that simple or easy. In fact, it is rather dirty and hard. In this age of so many copycats, you must pay greater attention to what makes you original and separates you from the pack. <br> - Councillor Onyeama</p>

                <p>The social battles of life are not won by greed, hate, jealousy and envy, but by calculated strategy. All of us are social actors and we create different moods that suit our ego and vanity. Worse still, we can be a little dramatic in our narcissism. Your goal as a strategist is to understand these moods and give them the buzz or quietness they deserve.</p>

                    <p>What are your favourite lines in YOUR PERSON IN A WORLD OF PEOPLE? üòçüìå This on page 118 (print) seems to be one of Debbie's: <br><br> Nagging back at people is the highest form of foolishness; perhaps an aspect of madness. A true realist regards naggers as babies or noisemakers at best. Performers on stage, that‚Äôs what they are. Rather than shout down the performer, you should enjoy the drama no matter how annoyingly monotonous it gets. To do this requires the highest level of control over your mind because, in the heat of the moment, the lure to burst your anger out becomes more unbearable. But to be a realist demands  of you to be the master of your mind. Responding with the same madness could get the situation grosser and out of control, resulting in a bout or perpetual animosity you just might not be ready for. Such naggers could be your spouse, parent, boss or colleague at work, mentor, friend, lover, or even your child.</p>

                    <p>One of the 13 Guidewords you must know while working with a boss or superior. <br><br> Most of us go into the labour market unprepared. No one ever told us it's full of power games and manoeuvre‚Äîpeople fighting for positions and subtly making the necessary moves for validation even at the expense of their colleagues. Worse still are bosses who are more than willing to fire us at anytime‚Äîit's never hard to find our replacement no matter how good we think we were. No one ever prepared us for this mess and we are often left in the lurch. <br><br> The biggest "I don't know how" concern for all employees is how to work with the boss and still avoid being entrapped‚Äîbeing used and never finding an escape. <br><br> Get a copy üìïüìñ and be guided through it all. Work better. Be no one's slave. Never take your boss for granted. Be clever. üòâ</p>

                    <h3>Between Faith & Reality</h3>
                    <p>One of the reasons I have Chapter One (Did You Really Evolve Or Were You Created? Your Ultimate Search For The Truth) in my book is because during the course of my research I discovered that most people are "faith blind." And they may never get to see because religion, Karl Marx said, is the opium of the masses. What chapter one teaches is letting you know that God is never your problem, people are‚Äîthe ones using religion to manoeuvre and advance their cause and your overall ignorance of the survival game. If you observe the lives of virtually all successful people, they love God but are never religious or faith blind. Let the teachings of this chapter put you through in acquiring the most important knowledge of all: What makes all of us Humans and not Angels. When you are fully aware of this, only then can you be able to think for yourself and never lose your presence of mind.</p>

                    <h3>THE BITTER TRUTH</h3>
                    <p>In this life, some people inherited riches while others inherited poverty. The former are often children of the rich or those from well-to-do families where their pleasant future is a guarantee. The latter are simply the polar opposite, those whom their parents left NOTHING for but instead passed poverty onto them. <br><br> Life can be as hard as hell for those who belong to the second category. In fact, most of them never make it in life. But what you inherited is not what limits you the most; your limitation is often a general lack of AMBITION to rewrite your history. Be a Person of Ambition!</p>
